This Python project employs various libraries to create a voice-activated assistant with a graphical user interface (GUI). The program utilizes the speech_recognition library to recognize voice commands and convert them to text using the Google Speech Recognition API. The pyttsx3 library is employed for text-to-speech synthesis, enabling the assistant to respond vocally.

The assistant greets users based on the time of day, provides current date and time information, and executes various actions based on voice commands. Users can instruct the assistant to open YouTube, launch a web browser, inquire about the day and time, perform web searches, play music on YouTube, and even share jokes.

The graphical interface is built using the tkinter library, featuring a "SPEAK" button that initiates the program to listen for voice commands. The program is designed to be user-friendly, with a visual touch added through the incorporation of a logo.

The project highlights the seamless interaction between users and the assistant, making tasks efficient and enjoyable. With personalized greetings and a range of functionalities, this voice-activated assistant offers a versatile and engaging user experience.
